# Simplex Calc
This is a software to solve linear programming problems using simplex algorithms.

The software is actually split in 3 parts:
- A java API that receives a string as input, calculates the simplex and returns the solution as a string.
- A java GUI for the api, to run on desktops (JVM).
- A flutter mobile app that acts as GUI for the api, to run on Android and iOS devices.
